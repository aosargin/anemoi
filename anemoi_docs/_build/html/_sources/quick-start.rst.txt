Instructions for getting up and running. 
-----------------------------------------

Assuming you have Python 3 and git installed you should be able to just pip install:

.. code-block:: python

    pip install git+git://github.com/coryjog/anemoi

All the dependancies listed in required.txt should also install.

Otherwise, you can download the anemoi package from the master branch on GitHub and place the anemoi folder in your working directory. This option requires you to separately install all the needed Python packages within required.txt.
